PDF side-by-side

For my MS thesis I had some cases where I was creating figures by combining separate PDF figures into one PDF. Rather than do it manually in Adobe Illustrator or such, I wanted a command line tool. I couldn't find an existing one that did what I wanted, so I created this, which worked for my use case.
