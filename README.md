# pdfsbs
PDF side-by-side

For my MS thesis I had some cases where I was creating figures by combining separate PDF figures into one PDF. Rather than do it manually in Adobe Illustrator or such, I wanted a command line tool. I couldn't find an existing one that did what I wanted, so I created this, which worked for my use case. 

## Requires
* Working LaTeX installation with the geometry and pdfpages packages

## Installation
For example, download or `git clone` this repo somewhere and add the tool `pdf.sbs` to your path.
